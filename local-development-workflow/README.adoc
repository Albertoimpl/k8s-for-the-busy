=== Local Development Workflow

Now that we know how to properly create an application, containarize it and deploy it to Kubernetes it's time for us to extend it.
If we want to iterate over our app the manual way we have to go, execute jib, then kubectl apply again and so on.
We are going to introduce a couple of tools to help us with that.

==== Skaffold

Automatically detects changes, compile your application and deploys it for you.
The tool integrates with well jib and the IntelliJ Cloud Code plugin which makes it key for a great developer experience.

In order to use it we need to add a new file called `skaffold.yml` and move our Deployment and Service YAML files to a folder called `k8s`.

```
apiVersion: skaffold/v1beta15
kind: Config
build:
  artifacts:
    - image: albertoimpl/myapp-jib
      jib: {}
```

With that configured we can run it from the command line or through the IDE.
You can even debug and add a breakpoint to your code:

=== Kustomize

Now that we have the ability to iterate over our app, we are going to show how to customize it for different environments:
Kustomize lets you customize raw, template-free YAML files for multiple purposes, leaving the original YAML untouched and usable as is.

```
touch kustomization.yaml
kustomize edit add resource service.yaml
kustomize edit add resource deployment.yaml
```

will generate:

```
apiVersion: kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Kustomization
resources:
- k8s/deployment.yaml
- k8s/service.yaml
```

You can have profiles within Skaffold but we found that using Kustomize to represent them was a better approach that we can reuse to generate our real production deployment by using variants and overlays.

A variant is the outcome, in a cluster, of applying an overlay to a base.

```
~/app-kustomize
├── base
│   ├── deployment.yaml
│   ├── service.yaml
│   └── kustomization.yaml
└── overlays
    ├── development
    │   ├── kustomization.yaml
    │   └── replicas.yaml
    │   └── properties.yaml
    └── production
        ├── kustomization.yaml
        └── replicas.yaml
        └── properties.yaml
```


```
kustomize build overlays/development | kubectl apply -f -
```

```
kustomize build overlays/production | kubectl apply -f -
```
