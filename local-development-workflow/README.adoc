=== Local Development Workflow

Now that we know how to properly create an application, containarize it and deploy it to Kubernetes it's time for us to extend it.
If we want to iterate over our app the manual way we have to go, execute jib, then kubectl apply again and so on.
We are going to introduce a couple of tools to help us with that.

==== Skaffold

Automatically detects changes, compile your application and deploys it for you.
The tool integrates with well jib and the IntelliJ Cloud Code plugin which makes it key for a great developer experience.

In order to use it we need to add a new file called `skaffold.yml` and move our Deployment and Service YAML files to a folder called `k8s`.

```
apiVersion: skaffold/v1beta15
kind: Config
build:
  artifacts:
    - image: albertoimpl/myapp-jib
      jib: {}
```

With that configured we can run it from the command line or through the IDE.
You can even debug and add a breakpoint to your code:

=== Kustomize

Now that we have the ability to iterate over our app, we are going to show how to customize it for different environments:
Kustomize lets you customize raw, template-free YAML files for multiple purposes, leaving the original YAML untouched and usable as is.

```
touch kustomization.yaml
kustomize edit add resource service.yaml
kustomize edit add resource deployment.yaml
```

will generate:

```
apiVersion: kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Kustomization
resources:
- k8s/deployment.yaml
- k8s/service.yaml
```

You can have profiles within Skaffold but we found that using Kustomize to represent them was a better approach that we can reuse to generate our real production deployment by using variants and overlays.

A variant is the outcome, in a cluster, of applying an overlay to a base.

For that, we have to change our file structure a bit. We will have our original deployment and service, altogether with a new kustomization.yaml file:

```kustomization.yaml
apiVersion: kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Kustomization
resources:
  - deployment.yaml
  - service.yaml

```

Then, we are going to create overlays for development and for production:

```kustomization.yaml
resources:
  - ../../base
patchesStrategicMerge:
  - replicas.yaml
namePrefix: development-
```

We will decrease the number of replicas to 1 in our development environment:

```replicas.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  namespace: default
  name: myapp
spec:
  replicas: 1
```

And increase it to 5 in our production one:
```replicas.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  namespace: default
  name: myapp
spec:
  replicas: 5
```

This is the final structure:

```
~/app-kustomize
├── base
│   ├── deployment.yaml
│   ├── service.yaml
│   └── kustomization.yaml
└── overlays
    ├── development
    │   ├── kustomization.yaml
    │   └── replicas.yaml
    └── production
        ├── kustomization.yaml
        └── replicas.yaml
```

With overlays we can also provide different configurations depending on the environment.

For us get our development overlay:
```
kustomize build overlays/development
```

And for production just:
```
kustomize build overlays/production
```

We can commit and version those files or just apply them as part of the deployment process:
```
kustomize build overlays/production | kubectl apply -f -
```
